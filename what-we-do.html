			<h4>Noble invests in markets throughout the United States which have historically stable demand most often generated by major universities, medical centers and a diverse corporate presence. Noble’s strategy is to enhance a “B“ asset in an “A” location by reconfiguring and upgrading the physical product and optimizing the brand. This approach allows the organization to maximize revenue market share and operating margins, increase profitability and maximize asset value by creating a “core-like” yield.</h4>

					<p>Noble has developed three decades of relationships within a fragmented industry of private owner-operators of hotels as well as non-specialized lodging investors and maintains a comprehensive list of targeted assets and markets along with brand availability by sub market. Through our ongoing, pro-active dialogue with owners, lenders and advisors, Noble has been successful in sourcing direct investment opportunities. Noble is identified by lodging brokers and advisors as the go-to organization for assets that "need to be fixed" and maintains valuable partnerships with leading brands that has provided material investment opportunities for the organization.</p>

					<p>Noble's operational asset management and administration teams strategically select each of our hotel based general managers and director of sales and are responsible for the operational performance of our assets. Our operating teams then share in the success of their assets performance through participation in our carried interest pool and therefore, are motivated and aligned to run our hotels as an entrepreneurial, street corner business. Noble’s asset management team has regular on-site visits with our property teams to review market intelligence and demand generators for pricing opportunities. Noble's business intelligence system provides real-time data feeds from each of our hotels where we analyze metrics on a daily, weekly and monthly basis to mitigate risk and optimize performance. Our ability to shift strategy based on leading metrics and market trends allows us to capitalize on revenue opportunities and protect the integrity of our financial results.</p>
