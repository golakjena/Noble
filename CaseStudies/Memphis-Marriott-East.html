<h5>Investment Premise</h5>
<h5>Value Added Repositioning and Re-Branding</h5>
<p>Noble acquired the fee simple interest in a Holiday Inn located in the center of the corporate business district of Memphis, Tennessee which was unencumbered by brand and management.</p>
<p>While the hotel was well-built, the asset was in poor condition and the physical spaces were obsolete. Noble developed and executed a comprehensive redevelopment plan which included a complete exterior makeover, new guest rooms, re-configured public areas and meeting space and a vibrant new food and beverage offering. The plan allowed Noble to convert the existing hotel to a compact, corporate-transient oriented Marriott hotel at substantially below replacement cost.</p>
<h5>Strong Demand Market</h5>
<p>East Memphis is home to the world headquarters of International Paper, ServiceMaster and the executive headquarters of Federal Express, all Fortune 500 companies. Also, a significant healthcare customer base is present in the market through St. Francis Hospital and Baptist Memorial East.</p>
